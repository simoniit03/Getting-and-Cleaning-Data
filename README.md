This repository includes: a .R file (R script) named run_Analysis.R and pdf file (codebook) named CodeBook.md

The R script encompasses the codes for reading different .txt files (test and training set data files) to load data into R, combining them to obtain a cleaned and tidy data set. This code also adding descriptive names for each activity, fixing unusual featurs of variable names. The code subsetting a part of data responsible for variables having mean and standard deviation, calculating the average value of each variable for each subject and each activity and creating second data set. 
Finally the code is exporting those two datasets as .txt files (tidy_data.txt & tidy_avg_data.txt).

The CodeBook.md explains, how to interpret each variable and the steps involed in the whole process, the names of variables are also listed.
